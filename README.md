# The Community Science Museum

The Community Science Museum was my first semester project at Noroff. This project is made with HTML and CSS only.

## Description

The task I was given for this project was to create a responsive website for the Museum. The design was intended to encourage customers to visit the museum, and the target audience was children aged 7 to 15 years.
This project is made entirely in HTML & CSS.

## Built With

- HTML

## Future Plans

While this project works fine, I do have some ideas for changes I would like to make in the future.
